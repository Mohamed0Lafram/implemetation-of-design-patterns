# IMPLEMETATION-OF-DESIGN-PATTERNS
This repository demonstrates a custom implementation of the Principal-Agent pattern for AI agents, built entirely from scratch. The design focuses on three main agent types:

Principal (Reflect Agent) – Oversees the process, provides reflection, and delegates tasks.

Tool Agent – Specialized in executing tools and performing concrete actions.

React Agent – Acts in real-time based on observations, reacting to inputs using reasoning and available tools.

🔧 What's Inside?
✅ Custom-built framework — No reliance on LangChain or LangGraph; all logic and orchestration are developed manually.

🔄 Agent collaboration — Agents communicate and cooperate using message-passing and role-specific logic.

🧩 Modular design — Easily extend or swap components (tools, reasoning logic, memory, etc.).

🔍 Reflection loop — The Principal (Reflect agent) analyzes intermediate outputs and makes high-level decisions.

⚙️ Tool use — Agents can dynamically choose and invoke tools (e.g., search, calculator, file access) as part of their reasoning.
